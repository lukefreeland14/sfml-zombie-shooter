# 2D Simulation & Game Engine (C++ / SFML)

A real-time 2D simulation built in C++ using SFML.  
This project models enemy AI behavior, projectile motion, and collision detection using an object-oriented architecture and a structured game loop.

## Technical Highlights
- Designed object-oriented architecture (Game, Player, Enemy, Projectile classes)
- Implemented real-time simulation loop and state management system
- Developed enemy wave progression logic with increasing difficulty
- Built collision detection and projectile physics system
- Implemented sprite-sheet animation handling
- Debugged runtime and logic errors through iterative testing
